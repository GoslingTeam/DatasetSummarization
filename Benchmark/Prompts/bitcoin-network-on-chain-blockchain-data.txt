Some examples of these metrics include:\n- Total Supply\n- Hashrate\n- Difficulty\n- Block Size\n- Transaction Rate\n- Mempool Size\n- Miner Revenue\n- Fear and Greed Index\n- Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL)\n- Coin Days Destroyed (CDD)\n\nDescriptions of all column headers are included as part of the .csv files in this dataset and are also viewable below.\n\nThe current iteration of the dataset leverages the blockchain.com API to provide both daily and half-hourly data about the state of the chain, as well as daily metrics provided by lookintobitcoin.com. Future iterations of this dataset expect to utilise other sources of information as well. Please see the linked Kaggle Notebook under the Provenance section of this page for more information.\n\nCurrent sources of information include:\n- Blockchain.com\n- LookIntoBitcoin.com\n\nPlease recommend other sources of information that should also be added to this dataset.\n\nNote: The 1st Bitcoin block was mined on 3rd January 2009 by Satoshi, but the second was not mined until January 9th, 6 days later, hence the period of null data for many metrics between 3rd-9th January 2009.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThis is information \u2013 not financial advice or recommendation.
