All of the data was obtained from [The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) (NOAA), ensuring its authenticity. The dataset contains 1,392,575 instances and 23 features and uses **metric** units for measurement, named `the weather of 187 countries in 2020.csv`.\n\nThe weather observations were collected by stations located in 187 countries/regions, spanning from January 22, 2020 to July 27, 2020.\n\nWhen weather data is not available for a country or region, such as Guatemala, I use the nearest country or region with a weather station, as advised by the NOAA support team. However, this approach can lead to duplicated instances in the dataset, totaling about 320,000 instances. These instances are not truly duplicated, as each belongs to a country or region without its own weather station. In these cases, neighboring countries or regions, such as Mexico, report the weather situation for the affected regions to NOAA. While the weather situations may not be exactly the same in different regions, we can consider them to be the same to avoid potential errors, which may arise due to NOAA's grouping of regions.\n\n###Version 2:\n\nI've uploaded a new version of this dataset that has 1,026,119 instances and 23 features and uses **metric** units for measurement, named `the weather of 155 countries in 2020.csv`. This version has no duplicated instances. So, You can choose one of these to work with. And please feel free to give me feedback, or ask me questions in the discussion tab of the dataset.\n\n###The Feature Explanations:\n\n- STATION: The station identifier\n- Country/Region: The country or region where the station is located\n- DATE: The date of the weather observation in YYYY-MM-DD format\n- Year: The year of the weather observation\n- Month: The month of the weather observation\n- Day: The day of the weather observation\n- PRCP: The amount of precipitation (rain or snow)\n- SNWD: The depth of snow on the ground\n- TAVG: The average temperature\n- TMAX: The maximum temperature\n- TMIN: The minimum temperature\n- SNOW: The amount of snowfall\n- LATITUDE: The latitude of the station's location\n- LONGITUDE: The longitude of the station's location\n- ELEVATION: The elevation of the station's location\n- PRCP_ATTRIBUTES: Additional attributes for the precipitation data\n- TAVG_ATTRIBUTES: Additional attributes for the average temperature data\n- TMAX_ATTRIBUTES:  Additional attributes for the maximum temperature data\n- TMIN_ATTRIBUTES: Additional attributes for the minimum temperature data\n- DAPR: The number of days since the last precipitation of any amount\n- MDPR: The multiday precipitation total\n- WESD: The water equivalent of the snow depth on the ground\n- SNWD_ATTRIBUTES: Additional attributes for the snow depth data",
