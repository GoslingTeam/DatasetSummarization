The complete dataset provides a wealth of information, including detailed product reviews, metadata, category information, pricing data, brand details, and even image features.\n\n**A Costly Downtime:**\n\nIn August 2013, Amazon encountered a 40-minute website downtime, causing a notable loss of $4.8 million. This incident highlights the critical importance of maintaining a seamless online presence.\nThe 1-Click Innovation:\n\nAmazon's inventive prowess is exemplified by its patent on the \"1-Click\" buying feature. This technology was not only a game-changer for Amazon but is also licensed to other tech giants, including Apple.\nWarehouses on Steroids:\n\nAmazon's Phoenix fulfillment center is a colossal structure, spanning a jaw-dropping 1.2 million square feet.
