b'{"prompt": "Write a function called \\"rotate_list\\" that accepts a list and an integer \\"k\\" as input. The function should rotate the list by \\"k\\" positions to the right and return the new list.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```python\\nrotate_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3) # Output: [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]\\nrotate_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4) # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]\\nrotate_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 1) # Output: [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]\\n```\\n\\nTo solve this challenge, you can use Python\'s slice operator and list concatenation:\\n\\n```python\\ndef rotate_list(lst, k):\\n    start = lst[len(lst) - k:]\\n    end = lst[:len(lst) - k]\\n    return end + start\\n\\nprint(rotate_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3)) # [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]\\nprint(rotate_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4)) # [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]\\nprint(rotate_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 1)) # [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]\\n```\\n\\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.", "response": "1.  if i < 1:\\n        i = 1\\n    if j < i:\\n       '
