CMS' [Hospital Compare](https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?providerType=Hospital&redirect=true) program is a consumer-oriented website that provides information on \"the quality of care hospitals are providing to their patients.\"  CMS releases this quality data publicly in order to encourage hospitals to improve their quality and to help consumer make better decisions about which providers they visit.\n\n\"Hospital Compare provides data on over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals, including acute care hospitals, critical access hospitals (CAHs), children\u2019s hospitals, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Medical Centers, and hospital outpatient departments\"\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) uses a five-star quality rating system to measure the experiences Medicare beneficiaries have with their health plan and health care system \u2014 the Star Rating Program.

Since CMS provides overall performance data on over 4,000 facilities, I hope this data can help people answer the following questions:\n\n1.  Which hospitals have the best overall performance?  Best performance by measure such as Patient Experience?\n2.  Which states, cities, counties have the most high-performing hospitals?  The lowest performing hospitals?\n3.  How have individual hospitals overall performance changed between 2016 and 2020?  Are certain locations getting better or worse overall?",
