Most near-Earth objects are asteroids that range in size from about 10 feet (a few meters) to nearly 25 miles (40 kilometers) across.\n\nThe orbit of each object is computed by finding the elliptical path through space that best fits all the available observations, which often span many orbits over many years or decades. As more observations are made, the accuracy of an object's orbit improves dramatically, and it becomes possible to predict where an object will be years or even decades into the future \u2013 and whether it could come close to Earth.\n\n# Content \nThis dataset was made using the data from the NASA Open API website \nThis dataset has various information about the NEOs like:\n- NEO ID\n- Name\n- Designation\n- Absolute Magnitude\n- The minimum and the maximum estimated diameter in kilometers \n- Orbit ID\n- Orbit Class \n- Perihelion and Aphelion Distance\n- First and last observation date\n\n#Acknowledgements\n[NASA Open API\n](https://api.nasa.gov/)\n[Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroid-watch)\n\n",
