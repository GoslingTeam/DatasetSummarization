### What this data is about

The dataset "Household_power_consumption" contains measurements of electric power consumption in a single household, sampled at a one-minute interval over nearly four years. It includes various electrical quantities such as global active power, global reactive power, voltage, and global intensity, along with sub-metering values representing specific appliances' energy consumption.

### How this data could be used

- Energy consumption analysis
- Predictive modeling of power usage
- Anomaly detection in energy usage
- Time series forecasting of power consumption
- Clustering analysis of household energy patterns
