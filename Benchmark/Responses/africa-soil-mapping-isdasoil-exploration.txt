### What this data is about

This dataset, titled "AFRICA: Soil Analysis for iSDAsoil Mapping," provides comprehensive soil analysis data specifically for Africa. It includes measurements of various soil properties such as extractable aluminum, boron, calcium, organic carbon, total carbon, copper, electrical conductivity, iron, magnesium, manganese, total nitrogen, pH, extractable phosphorus, potassium, sodium, sulfur, and zinc. The data, collected from numerous locations across Africa over a span of years, is intended for use in creating detailed soil maps through the iSDAsoil project. The dataset is licensed under a CC-BY-4.0 license and can be cited using DOI: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/A69R5.

### How this data could be used

- Training and validating machine learning models for soil property prediction.
- Enhancing agricultural planning and management by understanding soil health and fertility.
- Conducting environmental and earth science research related to soil composition and properties.
- Supporting sustainable land use and conservation practices in Africa.
- Developing and refining digital soil maps and geographic information systems (GIS).
