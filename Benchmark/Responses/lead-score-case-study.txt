Based on the provided metadata and files for the "Lead Score - Upgrad Case study about X Education" dataset, here's a summary and guide on how to approach the case study:

## Dataset Overview

### Metadata
- **Title**: Lead Score - Upgrad Case study about X Education
- **Description**:
  - **Problem Statement**: The dataset is from a company called X Education, which sells online courses to professionals. They generate leads through various sources, including website forms and referrals. The goal is to build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score to each lead. The objective is to target potential leads more effectively, aiming for a conversion rate of around 80%.
  - **Goals**:
    1. Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score (0-100) to each lead.
    2. Adapt the model to handle future changes in requirements.
- **Keywords**: Classification, Logistic Regression, Lead Scoring, India

### Files
1. **Case Study - Leads Scoring presentation.pdf**: Contains a presentation related to the case study.
2. **Case Study - Leads Scoring.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook with steps or analyses related to the case study.
3. **lead scoring case study.pdf**: Likely contains detailed information or analysis related to the case study.
4. **Leads Data Dictionary.xlsx**: Provides a data dictionary explaining the columns and values in the dataset.
5. **Leads.csv**: Contains the actual data to be used for building the model.

## Approach

### 1. **Understanding the Data**

Start by exploring the **Leads.csv** file and the **Leads Data Dictionary.xlsx** to understand the features and structure of the dataset. Key columns to focus on:

- **Prospect ID**: Unique identifier for each lead.
- **Lead Number**: Numerical identifier for each lead.
- **Lead Origin, Lead Source**: Source from which the lead originated.
- **Do Not Email, Do Not Call**: Flags indicating preferences.
- **Converted**: Target variable indicating if the lead was converted (1) or not (0).
- **TotalVisits, Total Time Spent on Website, Page Views Per Visit**: Engagement metrics.
- **Country, Specialization, Current Occupation**: Demographic information.
- **Lead Quality, Lead Profile**: Quality and profile details.
- **Tags, Last Activity**: Additional features related to lead behavior.

### 2. **Preprocessing the Data**

- **Handle Missing Values**: Check for and impute or remove missing values.
- **Feature Encoding**: Convert categorical features to numerical using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardize numerical features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features if necessary, such as interaction terms or aggregated metrics.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Understand the Distribution**: Examine the distribution of target variables and features.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate correlations between features and the target variable.
- **Visualizations**: Use plots to visualize relationships, distributions, and potential outliers.

### 4. **Building the Model**

- **Logistic Regression**: Build and train a logistic regression model to predict the probability of conversion.
  - **Train-Test Split**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - **Model Training**: Fit the logistic regression model on the training data.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### 5. **Model Interpretation and Lead Scoring**

- **Lead Score Calculation**: Assign scores based on the probability of conversion predicted by the model.
- **Threshold Selection**: Choose an appropriate threshold to classify leads as hot or cold.
- **Model Adjustment**: Adjust the model based on future changes in requirements as described in the separate document.

### 6. **Documentation and Presentation**

- **Documentation**: Ensure that all steps, code, and findings are well-documented in the Jupyter Notebook.
- **Presentation**: Prepare a presentation summarizing the problem statement, approach, model results, and recommendations.

## Steps to Take

1. **Explore the provided files**:
   - Open and review the **Leads.csv** to understand the dataset.
   - Check the **Leads Data Dictionary.xlsx** for details on each feature.
   - Review the Jupyter Notebook and PDF documents for any pre-existing analysis or guidance.

2. **Build and train the logistic regression model**:
   - Use libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib` in Python.
   - Implement preprocessing, model training, and evaluation as discussed.

3. **Prepare the final deliverables**:
   - Document your process and findings in the Jupyter Notebook.
   - Create a presentation with key insights and recommendations based on your model.
