The Wikipedia Article Networks dataset comprises three distinct networks representing Wikipedia articles on chameleons, crocodiles, and squirrels. Here's a detailed breakdown of the dataset:

### Overview

1. **Description**: 
   - The dataset contains page-page networks extracted from the English Wikipedia as of December 2018.
   - It includes networks for specific topics: chameleons, crocodiles, and squirrels.
   - Each node in these networks represents a Wikipedia article, and edges represent mutual links between these articles.
   - Node features indicate the presence of certain informative nouns in the text of the articles.
   - Target data provides the average monthly traffic for each page between October 2017 and November 2018.

2. **Properties**:
   - **Directed**: No
   - **Node Features**: Yes
   - **Edge Features**: No
   - **Node Labels**: Yes (Continuous target)
   - **Temporal**: No

3. **Datasets and Statistics**:

   | Dataset    | Nodes | Edges | Density | Transitivity |
   |------------|-------|-------|---------|--------------|
   | Chameleon  | 2,277 | 31,421| 0.012   | 0.314        |
   | Crocodile  | 11,631| 170,918| 0.003   | 0.026        |
   | Squirrel   | 5,201 | 198,493| 0.015   | 0.348        |

4. **Possible Tasks**:
   - **Regression**: Predicting node traffic based on node features.
   - **Link Prediction**: Predicting potential future connections between nodes.
   - **Community Detection**: Identifying groups of nodes that are more densely connected.
   - **Network Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the networks.

### Dataset Files

1. **Chameleon Dataset**:
   - **chameleon_edges.csv**: Contains edges (pairs of node ids) in the chameleon network.
   - **chameleon_features.json**: Contains node features for the chameleon network.
   - **chameleon_target.csv**: Contains the average monthly traffic for each page in the chameleon network.

2. **Crocodile Dataset**:
   - **crocodile_edges.csv**: Contains edges (pairs of node ids) in the crocodile network.
   - **crocodile_features.json**: Contains node features for the crocodile network.
   - **crocodile_target.csv**: Contains the average monthly traffic for each page in the crocodile network.

3. **Squirrel Dataset**:
   - **squirrel_edges.csv**: Contains edges (pairs of node ids) in the squirrel network.
   - **squirrel_features.json**: Contains node features for the squirrel network.
   - **squirrel_target.csv**: Contains the average monthly traffic for each page in the squirrel network.

### Sample File Contents

- **Edges CSV Files**: List of node pairs (edges) indicating mutual links.
- **Features JSON Files**: Dictionary where each key is a node ID and the value is a list of features (informative nouns).
- **Target CSV Files**: List of node IDs and their corresponding average monthly traffic.

### Example Content:

- **Chameleon Edges CSV**:
  ```csv
  id1,id2
  2034,1939
  2034,2263
  ...
  ```

- **Chameleon Features JSON**:
  ```json
  {
    "2098": [1765, 3047, 630, ...],
    "47": [3001, 2690, ...],
    ...
  }
  ```

- **Chameleon Target CSV**:
  ```csv
  id,target
  0,171
  1,8089
  ...
  ```

This dataset is useful for studying various aspects of network analysis, particularly in the context of Wikipedia article interactions and traffic analysis.
