### What this data is about

The "NASA Near Earth Objects Information" dataset provides detailed information on near-Earth objects (NEOs), including asteroids and comets that come within 120 million miles of the Sun. It includes various attributes such as NEO IDs, names, designations, diameters, orbital characteristics, and observation dates. This dataset is compiled from NASA's Open API, offering insights into the sizes, orbits, and potential hazards of these celestial objects.

### How this data could be used

- Assessing potential impact risks of NEOs on Earth.
- Analyzing the distribution and characteristics of NEOs within the solar system.
- Tracking changes in the orbit and size estimates of NEOs over time.
- Supporting research in planetary defense and impact prevention strategies.
