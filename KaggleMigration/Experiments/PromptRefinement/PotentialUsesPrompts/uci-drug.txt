My doctor suggested and changed me onto 45mg mirtazapine and this medicine has saved my life. Thankfully I have had no side effects especially the most common - weight gain, I&#039;ve actually lost alot of weight. I still have suicidal thoughts but mirtazapine has saved me.""",10,28-Feb-12,22\r\n206473,Mesalamine,"Crohn\'s Disease, Maintenance","""My son has Crohn&#039;s disease and has done very well on the Asacol.

We became concerned when he began this last week, when he started taking the highest dose he will be on. For two days, he could hardly get out of bed, was very cranky, and slept for nearly 8 hours on a drive home from school vacation (very unusual for him.) I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should. Overall his behavior is better. \r\nWe have tried many different medications and so far this is the most effective.""",8,27-Apr-10,192\r\n92703,Lybrel,Birth Control,"""I u'
