Ð’ossible uses of the dataset include training machine learning models for predictive analytics in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing, where the goal is to forecast continuous values based on historical data. Another potential application is anomaly detection, where the model can identify outliers and unusual patterns in the data. Additionally, the dataset can be used for clustering analysis, where similar patterns and trends are grouped together, or for regression analysis, where the relationship between variables is studied. Furthermore, the dataset can be employed in recommendation systems, where personalized suggestions are generated based on user behavior and preferences.
