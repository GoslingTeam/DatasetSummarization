# Dataset Summarization

Authors: Georgy Andryushchenko, Zukhra Khadeeva

Implementation of the LLM-based solution for generating descriptive texts about datasets. The repository contains the following three summarizers:

1. KaggleMigrationSummarizer

    Produces three descriptions (collection method, dataset structure, potential uses) from dataset metadata and pieces of dataset files.

2. RegenerationSummarizer

    Produces a single paragraph from the three descriptions (collection method, dataset structure, potential uses).

3. SearchSummarizer

    Produces a single sentence from a single paragraph.

In this project we experimented with different prompt engineering techniques and compared the results of the approaches with the reference texts generated by ChatGPT and refined by us.
